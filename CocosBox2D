//create the world 
b2Vec2 gravity;
gravity.Set(x,x);
world = new b2World(gravity);
//delete world 
delete world;
world = NUll;

//let the world run  the function step do the step only do it once in evety timeStep,so you will have to put it in a constant call function (like update ) .and you'd better use the function world->clearForces() so you can clear all the force;
world->step(float32 timeStep,int32 velocityIteration,int32 position Iteration);
world->clearForces();
//all the objects and joints are created by the world ..now is a way to traverse the world
for(b2Body *body = world->getBodyList();b;b->getNext()){
    //wake up the objects   
    b->WakeUp();
}

//wrong way to traverse and delete the objects in the world
for(b2Body *b =world->getBodyList();b;b->getNext()){
      Sprite * role = (Sprite*)b->GetUserData();
      if(role->isDead())
      //after this function the b->getNext gonna return the wrong data
      world->destroyBody(b);
}
 
// the right way
b2Body * node = myWorld->GetBodyList(); 
while (node){
   b2Body *b_for_delete = node;
   node = node->getNext();
   Sprite * role = (Sprite*)b_for_delete->GetUserData();
      if(role->isDead())
      world->destroyBody(b);
}

//shape is for the collision test and Fixtures are for the dynamic physics simulation

//some basic attributes of fixtures
1.Density //密度 can use this to change the mass,and there is no mass attribute in fixture.
2.Friction//摩擦系数 between 0~1. friction = sqrtf(shape1->friction * shape2->friction).
3.Restitution //恢复（弹力）between 0~1. restitution= b2Max(shape1->restitution,shape2->restitution).
4.Filtering //用于碰撞筛选 划分可以进行碰撞的群体
